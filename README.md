## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library

### What I learned

I learned through hands-on experience how to integrate React with Vite and, at the same time, integrate TailwindCSS, improving my development time.


### Continued development

I will continue improving my skills with React and TailwindCSS to keep growing.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me to use external fonts instead of local ones, so that everyone can identify the type of font I used for this challenge.
